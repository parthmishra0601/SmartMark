## Challenges & Learning

During the development of this project, one of the primary challenges was resolving ECMAScript-related errors that occurred while building the application. ECMAScript is the standardized specification that defines how JavaScript works, and compatibility or configuration issues can sometimes lead to unexpected errors during development.

As my prior experience primarily involved developing applications using ReactJS, transitioning to Next.js required adapting to a different project structure, routing system, and rendering approach. Although Next.js is built on top of React, it introduces additional concepts such as server-side rendering, file-based routing, and optimized build processes, which required careful understanding.

To address these challenges, I independently analyzed error messages, reviewed documentation, and tested multiple solutions until the issues were resolved. This process strengthened my understanding of modern JavaScript environments and improved my ability to debug framework-related problems.

Overall, this experience enhanced my practical knowledge of Next.js and reinforced my problem-solving skills, which will support more efficient development and troubleshooting in future projects.
